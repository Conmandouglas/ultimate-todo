- Make a basic, functional to do list project, practice basic database skills
[check] backend
[check] frontend
[check] GIT
[check] Now add a log in screen, parse data, use bcrypt and add authenciation to passwords and salt them

- Test and make sure this works, as a BONUS CHALLENGE before react:
  - Make it so each user has multiple lists, like one list has some to do's, another has others
  - This WILL be a hard challenge, but it will test my relationship skills
[check] Make lists table
[check] Edit relations and make userid in lists table and not the reminders table
[check] instead of checking if reminders userid is equal to userid, check lists for userid
[check] then store the list from result.rows, as a list id
[check] now in reminders if the listid is equal to the listid in reminders render it

- I have completed the main part of the project!!! Now, don't worry about separating frontend and backend just yet, that is for the react module. All I need to do is:
  - Add bootstrap, make it look nicer
  - Play around with flexbox and grid, make this look like a professional website
  - Make an add list button
[] make a row of the list items, make each one next to eachother
[] make each to do in the middle with rounded corner paper like notepad in middle each div has a row with checkbox on left, then the title, edit is below

- Make sure separation of concerns is in place (html, css, javascript has their own files linked respectively, and using public folder)
- Add a sign in with google button, add a new app for google and get new keys

This website uses:
- HTMl, CSS, Javascript
- EJS
- Node & Express JS
- Express Parser
- bCrypt
- OAuth

This will be on my portfolio! This will be my final portfolio project before I get into react. Then I will work on a fancy portfolio. Remember, I DO have a future.

For auth:
1. study my other auth project
2. make a new notion page and take notes
3. use those notes, not copy paste, to add auth to this project.
